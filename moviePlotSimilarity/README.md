## Synopsis

This project is a research project which computes whether two movie plots are remake of each other or not.

## Motivation

Information can less readable or much complex to understand which reading the narration. But using this project we can reach a poing where we can compute the less complex narration.

## Installation

We should have following things in our system:
1. wordnet for java
2. Apache server


## Tests

In the interface which will work once we have started the server, 
open webFiles/narratives.html in the browser and submit plots and it will tell whether the plots are remake of each other or not.
